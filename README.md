# Logitech
This repository consist of the shiny app which I developed during my course of work at Logitech. 
You can run this script if you can develop a dataframe as required for this script. I am unfortunately not allowed to add the dataset here due to confidentiality issues but I believe having a look at the app with the comments can be very descriptive and can help to develop a similar app for your particular use.
