# Logitech
This repository consist of my R scripts which I developed while working with Logitech. First one, Anomaly detection, consist of anomaly detection ensemble model which I developed for finding anomalies in sales data. It has provisions to extract data from PostgreSQL database but I have removed my credentials from code as the data is confidential. 
But I believe the comments and code are themselves very descriptive and can be used to replicate for any use if required.
Second script, finalapp, is for the R shiny app which gives user an interface to have a look at the interactive sales graph with results of the Anomaly detection algorithm displayed over them.It has multiple tabs which further displays the promotional database(script for which I have added here).
You can run this script if you can develop a dataframe as required for this script. I am unfortunately not allowed to add the dataset here due to confidentiality issues but I believe having a look at the scripts with the comments can be very descriptive and can help to develop a similar app for your particular use.
In later times I am planning to add the database structure required for these scripts but for now kindly bear with the script.
